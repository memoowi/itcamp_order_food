## Files

> [!NOTE]
> A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.

## Tips

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using VSCode, sometimes when debugging using console, the input doesn't work, so you can just modify the console setting you're using by making a `launch.json` file in `.vscode` folder.
> you can just set the `"console"` property to `"terminal"`.
